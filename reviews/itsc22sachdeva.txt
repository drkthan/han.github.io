Comments to the author
======================

This study proposed GAPFORMER which combines the
Transformer and RNN architectures to better model and
personalize driver trajectory. In my view, there are a few
problems the authors should address. The specific comments
are provided as follows:
1. The first time the â€œMSEâ€ and â€œSGDâ€ appears in the
manuscript in P4, they should be marked with full name.
2. The font in the figures should be enlarged to make the
information clearer, such as in Figures 4, 5, 6.

This paper proposed GAPFORMER which combines the
Transformer and RNN architectures for the personalized
driver trajectory modeling. The content of the abstract is
all about the contribution of this study and lacks a
description of the research method. The abstract should be
improved.
