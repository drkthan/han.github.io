Comments to author (Associate Editor)
=====================================

The authors proposed a method to learn personalized driving
styles for drivers with limited data. Besides comments from
individual reviewers, major concerns are listed as below:
ï Environment impact Vs Driver's own driving styles, it is
not very clear how to differentiate the driver's action is
related to the driving styles or due to some other
environment changes, Some explanation can be added for
clarification. 
ï ACC systems variations: Some details can be added to
describe the differences on ACC systems involved. And will
that affect driver's decision?

======================

The paper proposes a method for learning personalized
adaptive cruise control models based on observations of a
particular driver's behavior on a small number of instances
of following a leading vehicle. The driver's preferences
are discovered through inverse reinforcement learning in a
discretized POMDP, which considers the speed and distance
to leading vehicle as observations and acceleration as the
action.

Overall, the paper goes into great detail explaining what
the authors did, but it doesn't explain why they made those
particular choices and how the results compare to state of
the art. I don't quite understand the evaluation metrics
used, but it seems that reported accuracy is evaluated with
respect to the outputs of some other custom model rather
than real observations. There are no baselines so I have no
way of judging how this method performs compared to
existing alternatives. Unfortunately, I'm not familiar with
the literature in this area, so I can not suggest suitable
baselines here. The contributions stated in Section I are
phrased in terms of what methods the authors used, rather
than what performance they accomplished or what hypotheses
they validated. The paper reads like a system description
lacking proper evaluation or statements of concrete
findings.

Other comments and questions:
1. The authors elect to use a model-free IRL method,
indicating that model-based approaches require knowing the
transition dynamics, but it seems to me that those are
available in this simplified driving simulation.
2. Related work lists existing papers in the area, but it
doesn't provide a synthesis that would allow the reader to
see the big picture.
3. It seems that the setting is very simplified, in
particular regarding discretization into a small number of
bins. This is not necessarily bad, but I would appreciate
some discussion about how far the system is form being
practical.
4. The writing could use some improvement. There are a lot
of sentences I couldn't make sense of, such as "In order to
evaluate that which cluster of drivers that
the driver in the target set is most similar to, we
compared
the KL-divergence".

Comments to the author
======================

This paper develops a method to learn a driver's personal
driving style from limited data for personalized adaptive
cruise control. The method is based on combination of
inverse reinforcement learning and other techniques. I
think it is appropriate for the conference. 

The state space is discrete with large discretization
widths for the driving phenomenon. For example,
vehicle-to-vehicle distances from 24 m to 48 m are
indistinguishable. Is this safe? What will happen if the
discretization width are decreased?

======================

The paper is concerned with the method to learn and
simulate individual driving styles so that the driver's
preferences can be appropriately taken into account. The
method is interesting and the simulation results are
convincing. Therefore I 
recommend the paper for publication, after correcting some
small typos, e.g. "can be learn" --> "can be learned" in
Introduction.

A small question to the authors:
In Conclusion you wrote "adapt the personalized model to a
more complex driving situaion". Could you explain about it
a bit more? (It does not need to be included in the paper
itself.) Is it also possible to consider how to avoid an
obstacle? With an obstacke we can also observe many
different reactions/preferences by drivers.

This paper addresses a method to adapt ACC parameters based
on driving style of a driver. They combined clustering
method, IRL-based reward learning, and POMDP solver to
adapt the parameters to the driver. They used dataset and
evaluated the performance using the drivers which have
enough number of events. 
While I believe this is a solid result, I have several
concerns. 

Major points:
>The model-based experimental driving trajectories
demonstrate that the P-ACC system can 
> provide a personalized driving experience.
I think this claim is not supported enough by the results. 
1. Gap between how drivers would like to drive and how they
would like to be driven [1,2] ñ Studies suggested there is
a gap between how they drive and how they prefer to be
driven by automation. E.g., [1] indicated that 30%
preferred opposite driving style to theirs. 
2. Study still not complete: They demonstrate the user can
be adapted to (clustering-based) types. However, it does
not mean adaptation to individual is achieved. User study
will help understand the effectiveness of the approach.  
3. Very simple parameterization for ACC ñ as the authors
describe in the conclusions section, only speed and
following distance. ACC should include maximum
acceleration/deacceleration and behavior when cut-in events
happened. 
Overall, solid study but could be improved with more
follow-up studies.
