=====================================

The paper is well-written and discusses an important topic
about a Personal ACC system description based on
cloud-vehicle collaboration. It integrates real-time driver
feedback adaptation to improve learning and match the
driverís preference. The paper is presented clearly and
organised, introducing a unique approach. However, the
authors should address the questions raised in the reviews.

This paper proposed an IRL and GPR-based framework for
personalized adatpive control. The main advantage is that
the drivers' real-time feedback is considered using GPR
compared to a traditional IRL-based framework. There are
some problems, 

1. The authors should specify the advantage of using a
discrete table DGPT instead of using the trained reward
machine by IRL. I think it is available since the action
space U of MDP is discrete. Besides, what is the defect if
using the possible acceleration as output of DGPT model? Is
it for computation cost concern, or to reduce the potential
dangerous action or rapid action change with similar state
by the methoned low-pass-filter? 

2. Please provide a detailed explanation of Algorithm 1
design. Besides, there are some typo errors in Alg.1, e.g.,
in line 14, f should be a subscript. Some defined Functions
and Parameters are not used.

======================

This is an interesting study and the authors have extended
their previous work on the off-line module with an online
module to adapt to the driverís real-time feedback. The
off-line module is designed with the aid of inverse
reinforcement learning to learn the reward function of the
driver and MDP is well formulated. Then, to better match
the driverís preferences, the authors have proposed a new
online module using Gaussian process regression to update
the driving gap preference in real time. Numerical
experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance
of the proposed framework. However, in my opinion, the
manuscript has some places that need to be further revised
and clarified.
ï	Section Introduction, Line 5: Please explain what
ìADASî stands for. I know it is ìAdvanced Driver Assistance
Systemsî, but it should be added in the context.
ï	Section Problem Formulation/A. System Architecture:
Please briefly introduce how the table is discretized. 
ï	Section Problem Formulation/B. Assumptions and
Specifications: Please clarify whether the action space is
discrete or continuous.
o	If the action space is discrete, please enumerate
them (either a list or a range plus steps is fine).
o	If the action space is continuous, please describe
the range.
ï	Section Methodology/B Online DGPT Adaption/ 1)
Feedback data preprocessing:
o	In this part, the authors express the worry about
the abnormal update and the need to filter necessary
update. Several criteria are designed, and one algorithm
pseudo code is provided. However, I feel a little confused
when comparing the pseudo code and text description. It
would be very helpful that the authors provide further
explanations to link the criteria with the code. e.g. some
notations in the text pointing out which lines in pseudo
code correspond to or comments in pseudo code explaining
the purpose of each line.
o	In pseudo code line 14, please explain whether g is
a multiplier or a function? If g is a function, please
define it.
ï	Section Methodology/C Controller Design: 
o	The connection between this section and the last
section confused me. Please clarify how the algorithm in
this section handle the output of GPR
o	There are several variables ìKî not defined in Eq.
(7). Please provide their definitions.
o	In the sentence of Line 7, ìThis approach has been
widely used in car-following models and has shown good
performance in various scenariosî. Why Equation (7) can
maintain a stable and safe distance. Please justify the
claim or add some references to it.
ï	Section Experiments and Results:
o	In A. Experiment Setup using HuiL Simulation
paragraph 3, the authors introduced a heuristic algorithm.
What is the purpose of this algorithm? Is this algorithm a
simple baseline or another proposed algorithm? If it is
another proposed algorithm that should be seen as the
contribution of this paper, please include it in
Methodology Section.
o	There are a number of hyperparameters in the
proposed model. It would be very helpful if the authors
list the value of hyperparameters.
o	For the results, it would be very helpful if the
author could provide detailed numerical data corresponding
to each scenario corresponding to different speed profiles.
o	In B. Results and Analysis paragraph 2, the authors
claim that ìThis advantage is observed in both seen and
unseen driving scenarios, Ö.î. However, it is not easy to
observe this advantage in the table. It would be very
helpful if the performance in both seen and unseen
scenarios is concluded and listed separately.
o	The authors utilize IRL to recover the reward based
on the trajectory data, but no data description can be
found. 
o	In equation (3), it seems that the product of alpha
and Phi(s) is dependent on t, please add such index in the
paper.
o	The ìequationî or ìEquationî should be unified.

======================

1. Overview: IRL is exactly the tool to learn driver's
behavior; Offline training plus online adaptation are
sufficient to keep good systematic performance
theoretically.
2. Related work: good and thorough analysis of the domain!
3. GPR is the right method when facing the regression
tasks.
4. Experiment: the authors have sincerely explained why
IRL+Online GPR wins in PoI while IRL+Online Heuristic wins
in NIM.
5. Advice: if there remains enough space, please explain
more on training phrase: how much data / how much time /
how many episodes you have spent on training the IRL agent?
Maybe details are listed in your previous work, but adding
some explanation will do no harm.

======================

In this paper, the authors present a framework for adaptive
cruise control. The proposed framework consists of an
offline learning module and an online adaptation module.
The offline learning module collects the human driving data
and feeds it to the inverse reinforcement learning
algorithm to learn individual driving styles, while the
online module uses the learning results and Gaussian
Process Regression for car speed control. Finally, they set
up simulation environments to evaluate their framework. 

The paper is well-structured and easy to follow. Here are
some concerns:
1. Since humans make decisions mainly based on the
surrounding traffic environment rather than just car speeds
and space gaps, I am afraid that the inputs for the
learning model are insufficient.

2. It would be better to show how difference between the
seen data and unseen data in the experiments to demonstrate
the generalization of the proposed method.

======================

This paper is well written and clear structured. From my
perspective, the methodology is clear. However, the result
analysis might be a little bit simple. Since this novel
methods have different components, authors might need to
run more experiments to prove the effectiveness of
different components; hence, the result analysis is not
very solid.
